# TripleX


A small C++ game where the player has to find the 3 digit code to get to the next level.


You can directly run the triplex file on your command line like

` ./triplex `

  or

` g++ TripleX.cpp -o triplex && ./triplex `

to compile then execute it. If you are running on Windows you have to change ` g++ ` to ` cl ` or whatever the c++ compiler you have.

Give 3 intigers with a space between them then hit enter.

You can quit the game with ` control + C `
